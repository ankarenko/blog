I set out to visit as many Latin American countries as possible, and without the birthplace of the liberator of the Spanish colonies, Simon Bolivar, this list would not have been complete. I was also very interested to see the life of one of the most dangerous countries in the world.

The idea of visiting Venezuela haunted me throughout my journey. I did not say a definite yes to myself, but unconsciously or not, but I was building the route so that with each new step the decision became easier for me. Eventually, a game of hide-and-seek with myself led me to the town of *Maicao*, a little provincial town which is 12km from the border with Venezuela. Now I couldn't help but go.

I decided to go just for a couple of days. Obviously, this period is not enough for such a large and rich in terms of nature and culture country. I was scouting to see if the news of the danger was exaggerated or not. Fly tickets were unjustifiably expensive, so I decided to cross the border by land. And yes, it was not a good idea at all.

# Stay out, she'll chew you up

Everyone I met while traveling in Central America told me that visiting Venezuela was too dangerous, especially across the land border. So I decided to prepare myself thoroughly. I left all my belongings at a hotel in Colombia. All I took were a small purse that held my phone and some dollar cash. Before the trip, I wrote to several hosts at *Airbnb* and asked about the situation in the city. Everyone said that the city was quiet. However, one of the hosts urged to be extremely careful when he knew of my decision to enter the country by land. The first bell.

The journey starts at the [*Terminal De Maicao*](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Terminal+De+Maicao/@11.3812451,-72.2307166,17.81z/data=!4m20!1m13!4m12!1m3!2m2!1d-72.130661!2d11.360308!1m6!1m2!1s0x8e8bf3d4d84f0267:0x31a1450de089a7c6!2sMaicao,+La+Guajira!2m2!1d-72.2422465!2d11.3800543!3e0!3m5!1s0x8e8bf178a41f3dc7:0xc74ee299f28b89e1!8m2!3d11.3813474!4d-72.2296355!16s%2Fg%2F11g8ykfnry) bus station. Here is a transport company that operates transportation to *Maracaibo*. These are not buses that take you to Venezuela, but old american worn out cars. It felt like I wasn't at colombian bus station, but in *Detroit* during filming of *8 Mile*.

So called "Buses" start running from 5 am and depart every half hour. The ticket price is <span class="rate" data-sym="COP" data-value="120000"/>, which is not cheap for a 3-hour journey. There were 6 people in the car, including the driver, all friendly in latin american manner. We drove to the border in 15 minutes.

# Crossing the border

The exit stamp was quickly placed. But during the entrance I started to have problems. The border guards were not satisfied that I had a 1-day *Airbnb* reservation. I needed to have at least 3 days. With difficulties, but still managed to get the entry stamp. Then there was a search and an impudent request to share $30. I pretended not to understand Spanish, an explanation with gestures followed, then an awkward silence, then I was released.

Great, now we can get to *Maracaibo* with a breeze, I thought, and I was wrong.

The entire road from the border all the way to the city itself is littered with various posts and services that conduct security checks. Official posts alternated with barricades of garbage, barrels and tires, which were arranged by people who looked more like bums. Both of them demanded money. All of them, in my opinion, are fed by taking illegal bribes. Our driver would always discreetly leave a small amount of money at each such stop.

The bums were not very interested in me, in opposite to the officials, who's attention to me was enourmous and annoying. I don't know what was the reason behind this. Did they simply wanted to earn money from me or my presence in such a non-tourist place was extremely suspicious for them, I don't know. Most probably, alltogether. In any case, the pattern was always the same. A stopover, a search, the same stupid and boring questions, then sometimes I was asked for money, even after they were realised that I didn't have any luggage or excess money.

In 90% of cases, I was released when I said that I had already given almost all the money, and I only had enough money left for food, housing, and the return trip. Which was almost truth. From all the monotony of such lengthy inspections, I want to highlight two episodes so that it is clear what you will be dealing with if you for some reason decide to do something like this.

# Episode 1. Invitation for X-rays

During the next stop and inspection of things, the policeman begins to carefully examine my only luggage - the purse. He obviously didn't like the news that I didn't have any other luggage and seemed suspicious. He continued to probe the purse until he found something. It felt like something was sewn inside. This was followed by a brilliant Tarantino dialogue

# Episode 2: The Police Station

In the village of [*Paraguaipoa*](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Paraguaipoa+4037,+Zulia,+Venezuela/@11.3483875,-71.9784846,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x8e8bfd66bacc65df:0x15cb62441aff7e1f!8m2!3d11.3505515!4d-71.9668082!16s%2Fg%2F120vzkl0), we were stopped by passing policemens on a motorcycle and asked to proceed to the police station,  where I was taken to a windowless and unfurnished room with an interrogation table. Then the same stupid questions and searches began, they even pulled all the bills out of my wallet. After a while, everyone relaxed and cheered up a little bit. The whole precinct came running to see me. I was just beginning to believe in their decency when they started demanding money from me again. I said there was no extra money. They cleverly pointed out to me the rest of the Colombian pessos in my wallet and pointed out that they were not accepted in Venezuela, so I could share them. I couldn't urgue with that, and I didn't want to make any disputes in a foreign country for <span class="rate" data-sym="COP" data-value="123000"/> so I gave what they asked for.

# Conclusion

In total, the journey, which is supposed to be 3 hours, end up being 9 with all checks and interrogations. I arrived in the city already at sunset, contrary to what I planned to. Tired, but impressed. My fellow travelers and the driver reacted to the situation with understanding, and if any dissatisfaction existed, it was directed in the direction of people in uniform.

The return journey was much easier, there were stops, but there were fewer of them, money was demanded, but not so categorically and not so often. We got to Colombia in 3 hours.

I strongly advise against using this route. I have traveled a large number of land borders, but I have never experienced such lawlessness and feelings of insecurity. I made a very good decision to leave my valuables in Colombia. I am sure that if I had more money, I would have been robbed to the skin under various pretexts. Despite the fact that fly tickets can be unnecessarily expensive, I recommend to buy it instead of crossing the border by land. You can pay many times more at the border.
