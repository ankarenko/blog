It turns out that despite the land border, there is no road between Panama and Colombia. The gap between the countries is called a Darién Gap. Why there is no connection? There are plenty of reasons for this, ranging from the high cost of construction to drug trafficking. Travel between countries is possible either by sea or by air. Although a direct flight from Panama City to Cartagena by low-cost airline Wingo was the cheapest, easiest and most convenient way, I decided to choose a different route. Difficult, expensive, but very exciting. I decided to cross the border by both motor plane and motor boat!

## Planning

Before I begin my story, I should briefly describe all the possible routes I've found.

**Usual**. The low-cost airline *Wingo* takes off from *Panama city* and lands in any major city in Colombia. The approximate cost is *$100-150* with luggage, everything is extremely simple and boring at the same time.

**Fancy boat**. Four-day yacht trips from *Colon*. The yacht runs for 4 days in the Caribbean, mooring at small islands along the way. The final stop is the city of *Cartagena*. The cost of such a trip is *$600*.

**Adventurous**. There are two ways to get to *Puerto Obaldia*. Either from *Panama City* by private motor plane, or from [*Carti*]((https://www.google.ru/maps/place/Puerto+de+Carti/@9.455113,-78.9821749,16.44z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1scarti+terminal!3m6!1s0x8e54ea2b92487dd5:0x305657f4e9bc62be!8m2!3d9.4550082!4d-78.9780588!15sCg5jYXJ0aSB0ZXJtaW5hbJIBLHJvYWRzX3BvcnRzX2FuZF9jYW5hbHNfZW5naW5lZXJzX2Fzc29jaWF0aW9u4AEA!16s%2Fg%2F11c56454c3)) by motor boat, which sails for 7-8 hours [(more details)](https://www.soultrotting.com/border-crossing-between-panama-and-colombia). To get *Carti* from *Panama City* you can either by taxi or by bus + hitchhiking. After reaching *Puerto Obaldia*, take a motor boat to *Capurgana*. From *Capurgana*, take another boat to the city of *Turbo*. From *Turbo*, take a bus in any direction. The approximate cost of the trip is $220.

I decided to take the adventurous path. I flew a motor plane over the Panamanian jungle and indigenous settlements, crossed the border in a motorboat, waited for good sailing weather on the Caribbean coast, where I met people who worked with Pablo Escobar. But first things first.

## Plane to Puerto Obaldia. 

On the Internet, I managed to find several outdated articles where the authors wrote about a regular plane of the company Panama Airlines. Currently, there are no such flights anymore. When I visited their office, I was given a private pilot's business card. I contacted him and confirmed my flight a few days later. The cost of the flight is *$130*, which includes 10kg luggage and 4kg hand luggage. Each additional kilogram of weight is *$3*. During check-in, you are asked to stand on the scale with your hand luggage. This is due to the small size and power of the aircraft. Departure is from [*Albrook A. Gelabert Airport*](https://www.google.ru/maps/place/Albrook+Gelabert+Airport/@8.9705832,-79.5600705,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8faca8a1cbb2f85b:0x111d1d322af8388!8m2!3d8.9705832!4d-79.5600705!16s%2Fm%2F03hhsd5).

The plane was much smaller than I expected. I knew that no Boeing would fly to a small Panamanian village surrounded by sea and jungle, but I was still surprised when I saw a 6-seater motor plane. The passenger compartment was full, and I was offered the co-pilot's seat. Whether such an experience is worth $130-of course!

The plane turned out to be a real latin public minibus with all the necessary attributes. A driver would go off the steering wheel to chat in Whats Up and straighten the plane when it was about to roll on a side. He would stop at runways to drop off some passengers and pick up new ones. I got off at the third stop, which was *Puerto Obaldia*, a small Panamanian border village.

# By motorboat to Capurgana (Colombia)

*Puerto Obaldia* is as nondescript as possible and is not worth staying there, so I recommend immediately go and put an exit stamp. At the migration office, you will be asked for a copy of the main page of the passport, it can be made in a front building for 25 cents, but I advise you to make it in advance in *Panama City* and not rely on the only copy machine in the village.


<p class="alert warning" style="font-size: 14px; font-style: italic">
I strongly recommend that you have all your documents in order and do not forget to put a stamp on your departure. Puerto Obaldia and Capurgana are small villages isolated from the mainland. If the border guards have a formal reason to refuse the stamp, they can take advantage of your hopeless situation and ask for a serious bribe. Personally, I have not encountered this, neither I have seen it in the articles of other travelers. However, I met a Peruvian with US citizenship, who was required to pay $400, because he did not have an entrance visa stamp in his passport to Colombia.

With the exit stamp, you go to the local port and ask for a boat to *Capurgana*. The approximate cost of the boat is *$40-50*, then divide by the number of passengers. This will be the normal price. I advise you to wait until you get the right number of fellow travelers. But keep in mind that they may not appear and you will have to pay the full amount.

Before traveling, I recommend buying large plastic bags to wrap your luggage in. The sea might be very rough, so don't expect to stay dry. 20-30 minutes of rocking in a boat, and we are in Colombia!

## Capurgana

At first glance, the town of *Capurgana* seems to be the most ordinary tourist village, but it is not. Here is what I managed to find out during a couple of days of stay.

**The community**. Locals have their own set of rules. If you take drugs, steal, behave immorally or aggressively, you are immediately sent to the mainland without the right to return. As a result, it is very safe here.

**The past**. This village was actively developed and promoted under Pablo Escabar, and everyone I met remembers him respectfully and with nastolgy. I've met people who personally knew and worked with Pablo (according to them). A five-minute walk along the coast, not far from the pier, there are abandoned hotels built with the money of drug dealers. Some time ago the state privatized these buildings, and over time they fell into disrepair.

**A hub for immigrants**. I saw a large number of strangers of African and Asian appearance arriving and crowding around the pier, then these people disappeared somewhere. Later I was told that these were immigrants who were trying to get to Panama through the jungle, through the *Darien Gap*, then through Central America to get to Mexico, from where they would try to sneak into the United States. Wildlife, armed border guards and tropical diseases make such a crossing into Russian roulette.

<p class="alert warning" style="font-size: 14px; font-style: italic">
I write all of the above from the words of local people. I do not know and I cannot vouch for the authenticity.
</p>

In general, the place is extremely interesting, but it's time to move on

## From *Capurgana* to *Turbo*
The ticket price is <span class="rate" data-sym="COP" data-value="85000"/>, departure at **8:00**. Sometimes the sea is too rough, and all the transportation is canceled, so be prepared for this. The duration of the voyage ranging from 2 to 3 hours, depending on the state of the sea. An additional <span class="rate" data-sym="COP" data-value="15000"/> will be charged for additional baggage, also a tax of <span class="rate" data-sym="COP" data-value="3500"/> will be applied as well.

The boat is rocking quite seriously, and also get ready for the fact that it will hit the surface of the waves strongly while driving. Therefore, I advise you to take something soft to put under yourself to save your spine. Also, don't forget the motion sickness pills.

In *Turbo* at the exit from the pier, a motorcycle taxi will be waiting. The price to the terminal is <span class="rate" data-sym="COP" data-value="5000"/>, which is not bad and saves a lot of time and effort, since the bus station is very far away.

## From Turbo to Cartagena
In *Turbo*, you can take a bus to any branch. When i arrived to the bus terminal, there was no direct bus to *Cartagena*, so I had to make a connection in *Monteria*. The total cost of the tickets was <span class="rate" data-sym="COP" data-value="100000"/>. I advise you to take direct buses whenever possible, otherwise you will spend a lot of time at the bus stops.
